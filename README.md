# Data Science
This repository contains both foundational and advanced data science work organized into focused domains. Though my primary area of expertise is finance, the projects, ideas, and insights in this repository pertain to an array of things ranging from financial modeling, financial analysis, scalable data workflows, and the intricacies of the math and visualizations used in data science. 

## Purpose:
The repository demonstrates the following:
- Technical breadth across the data science lifestyle
- Ability to build analytical infrastucture supporting invest decision-making
- Modern tool adoption for robust operational and financial analytics

*These capabilities strengthen valuation workflows, due diligence analysis, and portfolio management processes.*

## Contents:

### Mathematics:
Analytical Foundations:
- Linear Algebra
- Survival Analysis
- Discrete Math
- Probability & Statistics
- Calculus & Optimization
- Time Series Mathematics

*These components underpin forecasting, valuation modeling, and risk analysis workflows.*

### Data Structures & Algorithms:
Core computational foundations relevant to:
- Basics in Python, R & SQL
- Optimization Routines
- Scalable Data Engineering
- Analytical System Performance

*Includes implementation of sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and complexity analysis.*

### Data Engineering:
Production-grade workflows including:
- ETL Pipelines
- SQL & Database Design
- API Ingestion Frameworks
- Airflow DAGS
- Structured Data Pipelines for financial modeling, KPI tracking & reporting

*These engineering skills enable scalable, repeatable and automated analytic processeses, albeit largely in a financial context.* 

### Data Visualization:
Tools & dashboards developed using:
- Tableau
- Grafana
- R
- Python
- Quarto
- Excel

Emphasis is on:
- KPI Visualization
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Fianancial Trend Analysis
- Comparative Benchmarking
- Executive-ready Dashboards
- Shiny/Streamlit applications

### FUN INCLUSIONS:
I am fully colorblind, so I have also taken the liberty to include a variety of color palettes that are acceseible for people with color vision defficiency. Please keep in mind that not all color vision difficiencies are the same, but these palettes are widely accessible and have found the most success for myself, classmates, and friends as far as accessibility is concerned.
